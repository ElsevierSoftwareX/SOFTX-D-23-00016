# MartMi-BCI: A Matlab-based Real-Time Motor Imagery Brain-Computer Interface Platform v1.0

This work develops a Matlab-based real-time MI-BCI (MartMi-BCI) software, which involves two main modules, a real-time EEG analysis platform (RTEEGAP) and a model training platform (MTP). 
1. The RTEEGAP can realize real-time EEG analysis in time, frequency, and spatial domains and perform MI experiments with real-time feedback based on the OpenBCI device. 
2. The MTP can train the CSP-based MI classification model and visualize the time-frequency reaction map.

Ensure you have connected to an OpenBCI device (8-channel) before you open the RTEEGAP.m.
If you don't have an OpenBCI device, you can also open the MTP.m and select the './TestData/MotorImageryData/' folder to evaluate demo files recorded by the RTEEGAP.m.
